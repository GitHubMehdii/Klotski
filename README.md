### How to play

The goal is to release the large 2x2 tile from the board through the opening
centered at the bottom of the board. To select a piece, click on it. Then it can
be moved in any direction with the arroy keys, WASD, HJKL, or the arrow buttons.
Only the large 2x2 tile can leave the board, so you must plan carefully to
complete the puzzle in the fewest moves.

To reset the board to its original state, use the "reset" button or press the R
key. To quit the game, use the "quit button, the Q key, or simply close the
window.
